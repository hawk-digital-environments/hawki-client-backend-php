# bin/env - Your local dev helper

Having familiarized yourself with installing and understanding the project fundamentals in [Getting Started](getting-started-929492837.md), we'll now explore the tools that enhance your local development experience.

Welcome to the documentation for `bin/env`, the all-in-one command-line helper for the `hawki-client-backend-php` project. This tool is designed to streamline your local development workflow, from initial setup to daily tasks, ensuring a consistent and hassle-free experience for every developer on the team.

This chapter will guide you through its features, how to use it, and how you can extend it to fit your needs.

## Overview

`bin/env` is a self-contained command-line interface (CLI) written in Node.js and TypeScript. It lives in the `bin/` directory of your project and serves as a single entry point for managing your entire local development environment.

Its primary responsibilities include:
*   **Environment Setup**: Automatically configuring your `.env` file.
*   **Project Installation**: A one-command setup for new developers.
*   **Docker Management**: Simplified, project-aware wrappers around `docker compose` commands.
*   **Script Execution**: A central place to run common project scripts, such as tests or database migrations.

One of its key features is that it's **self-bootstrapping**. It manages its own Node.js version and dependencies, meaning you don't need to have Node.js or a specific `npm` version installed on your system to use it. Just run the script, and it handles the rest.

## Core Features & Benefits

Using `bin/env` provides several advantages for local development:

*   **Zero-Dependency Setup**: The tool automatically downloads a project-specific Node.js version into a local cache (`~/.bin-env`), completely isolated from your system's Node.js installation. This guarantees that the tool runs consistently for everyone, regardless of their machine's configuration.
*   **Simplified Installation**: New team members can get up and running with a single command: `bin/env install`. This command automates every step of the setup process, which we'll detail in the next section.
*   **Consistent Environment**: By encapsulating environment logic within the tool, we eliminate "it works on my machine" problems. Everyone uses the same commands and underlying configuration.
*   **Convenient Docker Wrappers**: Instead of remembering complex `docker compose` commands, you can use simple aliases like `bin/env up`, `bin/env ssh`, and `bin/env logs`. These commands are pre-configured for the project's specific services.
*   **Extensibility**: The tool is built with an addon architecture, making it easy to add new, project-specific commands without cluttering the project's root directory with dozens of shell scripts.

## Getting Started: The `install` Command

The first and most important command you will run is `install`. This command performs a complete, one-time setup of your local development environment.

To start, simply run:
```bash
./bin/env install
```
> Note: The command can also be run as `bin/env docker:install`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of what the `install` command does:

1.  **Dependency Check**: It inspects your system for required tools (like `mkcert` for SSL). If a dependency is missing, it will offer to install it for you using your system's package manager (e.g., Homebrew on macOS, APT/YUM on Linux, or Scoop on WSL/Windows).
2.  **Assigns a Unique IP Address**: To avoid port conflicts and allow multiple projects to run side-by-side, the installer assigns a unique loopback IP address for the project (e.g., `127.x.x.x`).
3.  **Generates a Local Domain**: It creates a friendly local domain name for your project, typically based on the project name (e.g., `hawki-client-backend-php.dev.local`).
4.  **Updates Hosts File**: It automatically adds an entry to your system's `hosts` file (`/etc/hosts` on Linux/macOS or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows) to map the new domain to the assigned IP address. **This step will require `sudo`/administrator privileges.**
5.  **Creates SSL Certificates**: Using `mkcert`, it generates a trusted local SSL certificate and key, enabling you to access your local site via HTTPS without browser warnings. These certificates are stored in `docker/certs/`.
6.  **Configures `.env` File**: It populates your `.env` file with all the generated values, such as `DOCKER_PROJECT_HOST`, `DOCKER_PROJECT_IP`, and sets `DOCKER_PROJECT_PROTOCOL` to `https`.
7.  **Starts the Environment**: Finally, it brings up all the necessary Docker containers using `docker compose up`.

After the process completes, your project will be running and accessible at a local HTTPS URL, like `https://hawki-client-backend-php.dev.local`. You can open it directly by running `bin/env open`.

## Common Commands

Here is a list of common commands you will use in your daily workflow.

| Command(s)                         | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `install`, `docker:install`        | Performs the one-time installation and setup of the project.                                                                          |
| `up`, `docker:up`                  | Starts the Docker environment in detached mode. Use `bin/env up -f` to attach and follow logs.                                        |
| `down`, `docker:down`              | Stops and removes the Docker containers.                                                                                              |
| `stop`, `docker:stop`              | Stops the Docker containers without removing them.                                                                                    |
| `restart`, `docker:restart`        | Restarts the Docker containers. Effectively runs `stop` then `up`.                                                                    |
| `open`, `docker:open`              | Opens your project's local URL in your default web browser.                                                                           |
| `ssh`, `docker:ssh [service]`      | Opens a shell (`bash` or `sh`) inside a container. Defaults to the `app` service. e.g. `bin/env ssh`                                   |
| `composer ...`                     | Executes any `composer` command inside the `app` container. e.g. `bin/env composer update`                                            |
| `logs`, `docker:logs`              | Shows logs from the containers. Use `-f` to follow logs and `--all` to show logs from all services.                                   |
| `test`                             | Executes the project's PHPUnit test suite inside the `app` container.                                                                 |
| `ps`, `docker:ps`                  | Lists the running Docker containers for this project.                                                                                 |

| `env:reset`                        | Resets your `.env` file to its default state based on the `.env.tpl` template, prompting you for any required values.                   |


## Extending `bin/env`

The `bin/env` tool is designed to be extensible. You can add your own commands, install new Node.js dependencies for your commands, and hook into core events.

### Adding New Commands

You can add custom commands by creating **addon files**. An addon is a TypeScript file ending in `.addon.ts` located in either `bin/_env/addons/` (for generic, reusable functionality) or `bin/_env/project/` (for project-specific scripts).

Here is a "Hello World" example. Create a file named `bin/_env/project/hello.addon.ts`:
```typescript
// bin/_env/project/hello.addon.ts
import type { AddonEntrypoint } from '@/loadAddons.js';

export const addon: AddonEntrypoint = async (context) => ({
  commands: async (program) => {
    program
      .command('hello')
      .description('A custom command that greets the user')
      .argument('[name]', 'The name to greet', 'World')
      .action(async (name) => {
        console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
        // You can access context properties like project paths
        console.log(`The project directory is: ${context.paths.projectDir}`);
      });
  },
});
```
After saving the file, your new command is immediately available:
```bash
./bin/env hello 'Awesome Developer'
# Output:
# Hello, Awesome Developer!
# The project directory is: /path/to/hawki-client-backend-php
```

### Adding NPM Dependencies

If your custom command requires a new Node.js dependency (e.g., an SDK or utility library), you must add it to the `bin/env` tool's own `package.json` file. Do not run `npm install` directly in the `bin/_env/` directory.

Instead, use the built-in `bin:npm` command, which ensures that the correct Node.js environment is used:
```bash
# To add a new dependency
./bin/env bin:npm install some-package

# To add a new development dependency
./bin/env bin:npm install --save-dev @types/some-package
```
This command will update `bin/_env/package.json` and install the package into `bin/_env/node_modules`, making it available to your addon scripts.

### Using the Events System

`bin/env` has an event system that allows addons to hook into its lifecycle. This is useful for running code before or after core actions. You can find a complete list of events by inspecting the source code, particularly files ending in `global.d.ts` within the `addons` directory.

For example, you could add a hook that runs before the `up` command starts the containers.

```typescript
// bin/_env/project/my-hook.addon.ts
import type { AddonEntrypoint } from '@/loadAddons.js';
import chalk from 'chalk';

export const addon: AddonEntrypoint = async (context) => ({
  events: async (events) => {
    // This event is fired just before 'docker compose up' is executed
    events.on('docker:up:before', async ({ args }) => {
      console.log(chalk.yellow('Custom hook: Containers are about to start!'));
      
      // You can even modify the arguments passed to the command.
      // For example, to force a build every time 'up' is called:
      // args.add('--build');
    });
  },
});
```
This simple but powerful system allows you to deeply integrate your custom logic into the `bin/env` workflow.
